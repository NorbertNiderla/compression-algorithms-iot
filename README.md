# Sprintz revised
Implementation of four Sprintz algorithm variants for IoT applications: Sprintz, Sprintz-Huff, Fire-Rice, Sprintz-tANS.

### Sprintz by Blalock
Original algorithm was invented by Blalock et al. and is described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02515.

### Repository
Main branch contains C library with compression and decompression functions implemented. Tests branch contains almost the same code, but rewritten as RiotOs application module.
